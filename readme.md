# Coding Task

## Technologies used

* Laravel 5.2
* Mysql
* jQuery
* Angular Js

## Generating Description

I have tried to follow the repository pattern in this task. Since the true respository pattern decouples Data Access 
Layer (DAL) with the application and logic layer, I am trying to make the underlying data access layer dynamic. The task
says that we should save the data in a file but I will first save the data to a mysql database. I will write another
repo class to make the data save / fetch in/from a CSV file.
  
### For the first release

* User add is complete 
    - User can go to the url users/create and add a user
    
### For future release

* The multiple education will be added where the education will be added with help of angularJs ( the add button works 
but does not save to database)
* The javascript validation will be done
* Valid data will be saved to the CSV and will be displayed by reading the saved file
* Write functional tests
* Few more styling will be added to make this look good
* All the assets file will be fetched from local files


### Special Note:
I was away trekking in Poonhill for four days, I have [http://kurtapasal.com](kurtapasal.com) that I am working on ( my wife's project )
and I am going away to Riverside Resort this Saturday and Sunday, so I will not be able to work on this. Please consider 
reviewing this code at the moment and give suggestions. I will complete this next week anyhow and you can give further suggestions

I have tried to do everything that I thought is the right way to do in this because I really want to learn the best ways to 
do things.
